## Write A Data Science Blog Post

This project will take a look at AirBnb's seattle listings and calendar data.My main motivation in this project is to find answers to the questions below:

* How are Airbnb prices changing in Seattle during the year?

* How is the distribution of the prices of the listed places?

* How is the price change by region within Seattle? Where are the most expensive and cheapest regions? Does the price vary by region in the year?

* How can we estimate the list price in a realistic way?


## Dependencies

The project requires the AirBnB Seattle data set here to be extracted on the top level of the working folder. Project dependencies are:

* Python 3.7

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* Pandas

* Numpy

* Scipy

## Results
The results are summarized in Jupyter notebook. You can also find the blog post where I comment the results.
